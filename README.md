## 勉強, 勉強, 勉強!!

Random small programs, written for my own amusement. They are composed as literate code, using [docco](docco/docco) for actual code and documentation generation.

* [floor.s](/lit/cs61c/floor.s.md): a (totally unnecessary) implementation of `floor` in MIPS assembly.
* [caches.c](/lit/cs61c/caches.c.md): basic experiment to test performance changes due to cache hit/misses.
* [promise.js](/lit/js/promise.js.md): an implementation of [A+ promises](https://promisesaplus.com/) using ES2015 syntax (without ES2015 promises themselves, of course).
